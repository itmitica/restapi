What is REST?
-------------
Representational state transfer.
An architectural pattern for interacting with resources via HTTP methods.
Describes six constraints:
    Uniform Interface
    Stateless
    Cacheable
    Client-Server
    Layered System
    Code on Demand (optional)


What is API?
------------
Application Programming Interfaces.
Set of functions that provides some business or technical capability.
Enable software to interact with other software through exposed functionality.
Can be called by applications by using a defined protocol.


What is representation?
-----------------------
Consists of data, metadata describing the data, and, on occasion, metadata to describe the metadata.
May indicate:
    the current state of the requested resource
    the desired state for the requested resource
    the value of some other resource
    some error condition for a response


What is state?
--------------
Application state or resource state.
Clients handle application state, servers handle resource state.


What is REST API?
-----------------
Manipulation of resources through representations.
Is structured according to the principles of Representational State Transfer.
Typically uses the JSON data format.


What are resources?
-------------------
A conceptual mapping to a set of entities representing services or data.


What are resource paths?
------------------------
The resource path should signify what resource the endpoint is associated with.
The resource path URI includes: domain, version, namespace, route.


What are path variables?
------------------------
Path variables enable dynamic routes.


What are routes?
----------------
A route is the “name” you use to access endpoints in resource paths, used in the URL.
A route can have multiple endpoints associated with it, and which is used depends on the HTTP verb:
  one endpoint: a GET client request on a resource/route may trigger a get_item method on server
  another endpoint: a PUT client request on the same resource/route may trigger a update_item method on server
  another endpoint: a DELETE client request on the same resource/route may trigger a delete_item method on server


What are endpoints?
-------------------
Endpoints are functions available through the API, accessible through a route, following a resource path.
Endpoints are the destination that a route needs to map to.
For any given route, you could have a number of different endpoints registered to it.
A route can have multiple endpoints associated with it, and which is used depends on the HTTP verb:
  one endpoint: a GET client request on a resource/route may trigger a get_item method on server
  another endpoint: a PUT client request on the same resource/route may trigger a update_item method on server
  another endpoint: a DELETE client request on the resource/route may trigger a delete_item method on server


What are HTTP methods?
----------------------
HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS.
